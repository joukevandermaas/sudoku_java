Syntax:
java SudokuSolver <filename> [-b]

Where <filename> refers to an UTF-16 encoded file that describes one or more
sudokus in the following format:

79.....23
..38..4..
1..2.6...
6...8.94.
....2....
.31.6...8
...7.1..5
..5..21..

Lines starting with % will be ignored.

The -b switch executes the solver in batch mode, solving all sudokus
in the file and reporting statistics. If this switch is left out,
the solver is executed in gui-mode.

The file sudokus.txt contains 10.000 sudokus generated by the Debian
sudoku-package (see http://packages.debian.org/sid/sudoku). This tool
can generate sudokus readable by the solver using:
	
	sudoku -fcompact -g<number>
	
where <number> is the number of sudokus to generate.
